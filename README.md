# AES_System_with_Arbiter_PUF
This is the graduated project for our department. 

## Physical Unclonable Functionâ€™s application and extension in Advanced Encryption Standard System
This project is the extension of the Arbiter PUF, using Verilog to simulate and implement on FPGA board. 
We take the advantages of PUF for its physical feature with AES to create the unique Key, which enhanced the security and broaden the application of PUF. 


## DEMO Video
* AES System implementation <br>

* AES System's key go through Arbiter PUF first, then regards the output from PUF as the key for AES System <br>

* Same with the above, but changes the data which is needed to be encrypted <br>
